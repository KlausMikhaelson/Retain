# Input Stash

I’m a student and a long time procrastinator when it comes to filling forms, I realized that I filled the gdsc lead form atleast 3-4 times because I was just abandoning it in the middle again and again, so had to rewrite everything from scratch

So thought of creating a simple browser extension that takes care of it, it will just save your text locally and when you open the extension on a particular url you will be able to see all the inputs that you filled for that website and you can just copy paste it lol

## steps:
- 1st unload the build in your browser and that's it, that's all you need to do!
